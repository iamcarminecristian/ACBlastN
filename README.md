# ACBlastN

The large amount of genomic data produced by Next Generation Sequencing technologies has raised new challenges for implementing highly scalable and efficient computational systems. In this undergraduate project, from the Advanced Operating Systems course, we propose ACBlastn, a parallelization of a sequence alignment application (BLAST) that employs cloud computing to provide computational resources and Apache Spark as the coordinating framework. The implementation was realized through the Scala programming language.
